# Overview

Many pressing climate and hazard challenges cannot be addressed within a single discipline, requiring integration across computational science, social science, and decision-making contexts. This project focuses on **convergence science**, integrating computational modeling with social science, engineering, and stakeholder perspectives to support real-world decision-making.

My role in these efforts often centers on translating advanced numerical models into forms that are meaningful and usable beyond disciplinary boundaries.

## Focus Areas

- Interdisciplinary climate and hazard research
- Decision-relevant interpretation of model outputs
- Integration of physical, social, and Indigenous knowledge systems
- Communication of uncertainty and risk
- Collaborative research design with stakeholders

## Contributions

- Development of modeling frameworks informed by stakeholder needs
- Risk-focused interpretation of complex simulation outputs
- Collaborative leadership in interdisciplinary research teams
- Support for policy- and planning-relevant climate assessments

Many of these efforts build directly on technical work in [Coastal Flooding & Storm Surge Modeling]({% link _projects/coastal_flooding_storm_surge.md %}) and [Uncertainty Quantification & Risk]({% link _projects/uncertainty_risk.md %}), extending their impact through interdisciplinary collaboration. These efforts emphasize the role of computational science not only as a technical tool, but as a bridge between disciplines and decision contexts.
