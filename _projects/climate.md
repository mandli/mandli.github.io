I work on a number of projects that aim to solve computational problems related to calculating risk at the coast. These projects often have as their primary goal to be able to calculate risk changes from climate change so that we can understand how our risk of flood will change due to a particular climate scenario. This also invovles exploring how we are sensitive to various inputs to the models and what in the climate might make the largest difference to our coastal flood risk.
