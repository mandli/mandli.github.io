[PyClaw](https://pyclaw.org) is a Python package that solves hyperbolic PDEs with a Python interface with similar capabilities to the other Clawpack packages. It contains pure Python versions of the 1D solvers and Fortran compiled core solvers for higher dimensions and other capabilities such as WENO Finite Volume methods and massively parallel solvers using a PETSc backend.
