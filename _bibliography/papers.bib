author = {Mandli, Kyle T}, 
abstract = {{Coastal hazards related to strong storms such as hurricanes and typhoons are one of the most frequently recurring and wide spread hazards to coastal communities. Storm surges are among the most devastating effects of these storms, and their prediction and mitigation is of great interest to coastal communities that need to plan for the subsequent rise in sea level during these storms. Past efforts to model storm surge have usually focused on the single-layer shallow water equations, due to the ease of com- puting a simulation on the relevant scales and domains relative to three-dimensional modeling. The drawback to this approach is that the primary generating mechanism for storm surge is the wind-momentum transfer to the ocean. This boundary layer phenomenon is not well-represented by the shallow water equations, especially in the deep ocean. An alternative is to use the two-layer shallow water equations, with a shallow upper layer driven by the wind and an abyssal layer representing the rest of the water column.
 The focus of this thesis is on the development of a finite volume method for the multi-layer shallow water equations that is appropriate for application to storm surges. This has been done in the context of the GeoClaw framework, a code designed to handle the single-layer shallow water equations with adaptive mesh refinement al-
 gorithms, and uses many of the capabilities available to GeoClaw that are pertinent to storm surges. Approximations to the system are also discussed and tested along with methods for handling dry-states and inundation. Finally, idealized storm surge test cases comparing the single-layer and two-layer shallow water equations are explored.}},

The software described here is PyClaw, a Python-based structured grid solver for general systems of hyperbolic PDEs [K. T.

PyClaw provides a powerful and intuitive interface to the algorithms of the existing Fortran codes Clawpack and SharpClaw, simplifying code development and use while providing massive parallelism and scalable solvers via the PETSc library. The package is further augmented by use of PyWENO for generation of efficient high-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory reconstruction code. The simplicity, capability, and performance of this approach are demonstrated through application to example problems in shallow water flow, compressible flow, and elasticity.}},

Thus, computation on each patch can be optimized for speed, while we inherit the flexibility of adaptive meshes. In our work we choose to integrate with the p4est AMR library since it allows us to compose the mesh from multiple mapped octrees and enables the cubed sphere and other nontrivial multiblock geometries.

Coastal inundation, caused by hurricanes and tropical storms, poses large risks for today's societies. High-fidelity numerical models of water levels driven by hurricane-force winds are required to predict these events, posing a challenging computational problem, and even though computational models continue to improve, uncertainties in storm surge forecasts are inevitable. Today, this uncertainty is often exposed to the user by running the simulation many times with different parameters or inputs following a Monte-Carlo framework in which uncertainties are represented as stochastic quantities. This results in multidimensional, multivariate and multivalued data, so-called ensemble data. While the resulting datasets are very comprehensive, they are also huge in size and thus hard to visualize and interpret. In this paper, we tackle this problem by means of an interactive and integrated visual analysis system. By harnessing the power of modern graphics processing units for visualization as well as computation, our system allows the user to browse through the simulation ensembles in real time, view specific parameter settings or simulation models and move between different spatial and temporal regions without delay. In addition, our system provides advanced visualizations to highlight the uncertainty or show the complete distribution of the simulations at user-defined positions over the complete time series of the prediction. We highlight the benefits of our system by presenting its application in a real-world scenario using a simulation of Hurricane Ike.}},

In this paper, a new analysis is performed with the goal of inferring the fault slip distribution of the Tōhoku earthquake using a similar problem setup. The same approach to constructing the PC surrogate did not lead to a converging expansion; however, an alternative approach based on basis pursuit denoising was found to be suitable. Our result shows that the fault slip distribution can be inferred using water surface elevation data whereas the inferred values minimize the error between observations and the numerical model.

We are particularly interested in the Bayesian inference of the location, the orientation, and the slip of an Okada-based model of the earthquake ocean floor displacement. The tsunami numerical model is based on the GeoClaw software while the observational data is provided by a single DARTⓇ buoy. We propose in this paper a methodology based on polynomial chaos expansion to construct a surrogate model of the wave height at the buoy location. A correlated noise model is first proposed in order to represent the discrepancy between the computational model and the data. This step is necessary, as a classical independent Gaussian noise is shown to be unsuitable for modeling the error, and to prevent convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler. Second, the polynomial chaos model is subsequently improved to handle the variability of the arrival time of the wave, using a preconditioned non-intrusive spectral method. Finally, the construction of a reduced model dedicated to Bayesian inference is proposed. Numerical results are presented and discussed.}},

In contrast, the surface area (0.89 km2) and volume of Thulagi lake (76 m maximum observed depth; 36.1 × 106 m3; surveyed in October 2017) has remained almost stable for about two decades. Analyses of changes in the moraine dams of the three lakes using digital elevation models (DEMs) quantifies the degradation of the dams due to the melting of their ice cores and hence their natural lowering rates as well as the potential for glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). We examined the likely future evolution of lake growth and hazard processes associated with lake instability, which suggests faster growth and increased hazard potential at Lower Barun lake.}},

Many such disasters could be mitigated through improved emergency evacuation in real-time and through the development of resilient infrastructure based on knowledge of how systems respond to extreme events. Data-driven computational modeling is a critical technology underpinning these efforts. This investigation focuses on the novel combination of methodologies in forward simulation and data assimilation. The forward geophysical model utilizes adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), a process by which a computational mesh can adapt in time and space based on the current state of a simulation. The forward solution is combined with ensemble based data assimilation methods, whereby observations from an event are assimilated into the forward simulation to improve the veracity of the solution, or used to invert for uncertain physical parameters. The novelty in our approach is the tight two-way coupling of AMR and ensemble filtering techniques. The technology is tested using actual data from the Chile tsunami event of February 27, 2010. These advances offer the promise of significantly transforming data-driven, real-time modeling of hydrological hazards, with potentially broader applications in other science domains.}},

abstract = {{This work tackles the problem of calibrating the unknown parameters of a debris flow model with the drawback that the information regarding the experimental data treatment and processing is not available. In particular, we focus on the evolution over time of the flow thickness of the debris with dam-break initial conditions. The proposed methodology consists of establishing an approximation of the numerical model using a polynomial chaos expansion that is used in place of the original model, saving computational burden. The values of the parameters are then inferred through a Bayesian approach with a particular focus on inference discrepancies that some of the important features predicted by the model exhibit. We build the model approximation using a preconditioned non-intrusive method and show that a suitable prior parameter distribution is critical to the construction of an accurate surrogate model. The results of the Bayesian inference suggest that utilizing directly the available experimental data could lead to incorrect conclusions, including the over-determination of parameters. To avoid such drawbacks, we propose to base the inference on few significant features extracted from the original data. Our experiments confirm the validity of this approach, and show that it does not lead to significant loss of information. It is further computationally more efficient than the direct approach, and can avoid the construction of an elaborate error model.}},

The authors first determine, based on a review of primary sources, that the Bombay cyclone of 1882, documented in a number of print and internet sources and claimed to have caused 100,000 or more deaths, did not occur. Two different tropical cyclone hazard models, both of which generate large numbers of synthetic cyclones using environmental data - here taken from reanalyses in the satellite era - as input, are then used to quantify the hazard, in conjunction with historical observations. Both models indicate that a severe cyclone landfall at or near Mumbai is possible, though unlikely in any given year. Return periods for wind speeds exceeding 100 kt (the threshold for category 3 in the Saffir-Simpson scale) at Mumbai itself are estimated to be in the range of thousands to greater than ten thousand years, while the return period for a storm with maximum wind speed of 100 kt or greater passing within 150 km of Mumbai (possibly close enough to generate a substantial storm surge at the city) is estimated to be around 500 years. Return periods for winds exceeding 65 kt (hurricane intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale) are estimated to be around 200 years at Mumbai itself, 50–90 years within 150 km. Climate change is not explicitly considered in this study, but the hazard to the city is likely to be increasing due to sea level rise as well as changes in storm climatology.}},

We solve a novel system of balance equations derived from the Navier–Stokes equations known as moment field equations. The main advantage of our approach is that we do not assume a priori that the stochastic random variables that quantify the turbulent energy transfer between air and water are Gaussian. We generate non-conservative multifractal measures of turbulent energy transfer using a recursive integration process and a self-affine velocity kernel. The kernel exactly satisfies the (duration limited) kinetic equation for waves as well as invariant scaling properties of the Navier–Stokes equations. This allows us to derive source terms for the moment field equations using a turbulent diffusion operator. The operator quantifies energy transfer along a space time path associated with pressure instabilities in the air–sea interface and transfers the statistical shape (or fractal dimension) of the atmosphere to the wind-sea. Because we use observational data to begin the recursive integration process, the ocean–atmosphere interaction is inherently built into the model. Numerical results from application of our methods to air–sea turbulence off the coast of New Jersey and New York indicate that our methods produce measures of turbulent energy transfer that match theory and observation, and, correspondingly, significant wave heights and average wave periods predicted by our model qualitatively match buoy data.}},

abstract = {{It is generally acknowledged that interdependent critical infrastructure in coastal urban areas is constantly threatened by storm-induced flooding. Due to changing climate effects, such as sea level rise (SLR), the occurrence of catastrophic events will be more frequent and may trigger an increased likelihood of severe hazards. Planning a protective measure or mitigation strategy is a complex problem given the constraints that it must fit within a prescribed and limited fiscal budget and be beneficial to the community it protects both socially and economically. This article proposes a methodology for optimizing protective measures and mitigation strategies for interdependent infrastructures subjected to storm-induced flooding and climate change impacts such as SLR. Optimality is defined in this methodology as a maximum reduction in overall expected losses within a prescribed budget (compared to the expected losses in the case of doing nothing for protection/mitigation). Protective measures can include seawalls, barriers, artificial dunes, restoration of wetlands, raising individual buildings, sealing parts of the infrastructure, strategic retreat, insurance, and many more. The optimal protective strategy can be a combination of several protective measures implemented over space and time. The optimization process starts with parameterizing the protective measures. Storm-induced flooding and SLR, and their corresponding consequences, are estimated using a GIS-based subdivision-redistribution methodology (GISSR) developed by the authors for finding a rough solution in the first brute-force iterations of the optimization loop. A storm surge computational model called GeoClaw is subsequently used to simulate ensembles of synthetic storms in order to fine-tune and achieve the optimal solution. Damage loss, including economic impacts, is quantified based on calculated flood estimates. The suitability of the potential optimal solution is examined and assessed with input from stakeholders' interviews. It should be mentioned that the results and conclusions provided in this work depend on the assumptions made about future sea level rise (SLR). The authors acknowledge that there are other, more severe predictions for sea level rise (SLR), than the one used in this paper.}},

The inclusion of translation speed and coastal geometry information lead to improvements of the SSHPI to other existing surge indices. A retrospective analysis of SSHPI using data from 1978–2019 in Japan suggests that this index captures historical events reasonably well. In particular, it explains \textbackslashtextasciitilde 66\% of the observed variance and \textbackslashtextasciitilde 74\% for those induced by TCs whose landfall intensity was larger than 79-kt. The performance of SSHPI is not sensitive to the type of coastal geometry (open coasts or semi-enclosed bays). Such a prediction methodology can decrease numerical computation requirements, improve public awareness of surge hazards, and may also be useful for communicating surge risk.}},

They support water management decisions, provide the opportunity to mitigate the impacts of weather‐ and flood‐related disasters and potentially save lives and properties. Channel flow routing is a key component of these models and affects their ability to forecast flood depth, duration, and extent. Continental scale channel flow routing within the operational forecasting environments encounters a broad spectrum of hydraulic characteristics. Deploying computationally demanding approaches, such as the dynamic wave, should be limited in time and space to conditions where the inertia terms are significant (typically in low‐gradient environments and whenever backwater effects are prominent); otherwise, efficient and robust methods, e.g., Kinematic, Muskingum‐Cunge or diffusive waves should be the default. The heterogeneous routing approach presented here provides a framework to evaluate the balance between friction, inertia, and pressure and strategically triggers the appropriate wave approximation. The strategy recommended here is to activate the appropriate wave approximation based on the ambient hydraulic conditions, and smoothly transitions among these approximations. This strategy, if successfully implemented, would strike a balance among the performance metrics of operational forecasting models, namely, computational efficiency, accuracy, and minimization of computational instabilities. Research Impact Statement: A heterogeneous routing strategy, driven by the surrounding hydraulic conditions, activates terms in the momentum equation as needed to strike a balance between computational speed and accuracy.}},

We apply the model on the Delaware Estuary to simulate extreme water level and to investigate the contribution of different physical components to it during Hurricane Isabel (2003).

Model results suggest that storm surge is the most dominating component of extreme water level with an average contribution of 78.16\%, second by the astronomical tide with 19.52\%.

We further propose a novel method, called tidal vanishing point (TVP), for delineating the extent of CTZs through the upland. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework over the United States East and Gulf coasts. We categorize CTZs in the region into three classes, namely, without estuary (direct river–coast connection), triangular‐, and trapezoidal‐shaped estuary. The results show that although semidiurnal tidal constituents are dominant in most cases, diurnal tidal constituents become more prevalent in the river segment as the discharge increases. Also, decreasing the bed roughness value promotes more significant changes in the results than increasing it by the same value. Additionally, the estuary promotes tidal energy attenuation and consequently decreases the reach of tidal signals through the upland. The proposed framework is generic and extensible to any coastal region.}},

The first hour of eruptive activity produced fast-propagating tsunami waves, long-period seismic waves, loud audible sound waves, infrasonic waves, exceptionally intense volcanic lightning and an unsteady volcanic plume that transiently reached—at 58 ​km—the Earth's mesosphere. Energetic seismic signals were recorded worldwide and the globally stacked seismogram showed episodic seismic events within the most intense periods of phreatoplinian activity, and they correlated well with the infrasound pressure waveform recorded in Fiji. Gravity wave signals were strong enough to be observed over the entire planet in just the first few hours, with some circling the Earth multiple times subsequently. These large-amplitude, long-wavelength atmospheric disturbances come from the Earth's atmosphere being forced by the magmatic mixture of tephra, melt and gasses emitted by the unsteady but quasi-continuous eruption from 0402±1–1800 UTC on January 15, 2022. Atmospheric forcing lasted much longer than rupturing from large earthquakes recorded on modern instruments, producing a type of shock wave that originated from the interaction between compressed air and ambient (wavy) sea surface. This scenario differs from conventional ideas of earthquake slip, landslides, or caldera collapse-generated tsunami waves because of the enormous (∼1000x) volumetric change due to the supercritical nature of volatiles associated with the hot, volatile-rich phreatoplinian plume. The time series of plume altitude can be translated to volumetric discharge and mass flow rate. For an eruption duration of ∼12 ​h, the eruptive volume and mass are estimated at 1.9 ​km3 and ∼2 900 ​Tg, respectively, corresponding to a VEI of 5–6 for this event. The high frequency and intensity of lightning was enhanced by the production of fine ash due to magma—seawater interaction with concomitant high charge per unit mass and the high pre-eruptive concentration of dissolved volatiles. Analysis of lightning flash frequencies provides a rapid metric for plume activity and eruption magnitude. Many aspects of this eruption await further investigation by multidisciplinary teams. It represents a unique opportunity for fundamental research regarding the complex, non-linear behavior of high energetic volcanic eruptions and attendant phenomena, with critical implications for hazard mitigation, volcano forecasting, and first-response efforts in future disasters.}},

An appropriate selection of two‐dimensional (2D) models that integrate riverine and estuarine interactions with ocean dynamics is crucial to generate accurate TWL predictions and assist stakeholders and federal agencies in decision making and flood emergency responses. In this study, we compare the performance of two widely used hydrodynamic models (e.g., 2D HEC‐RAS and Delft3D‐Flexible Mesh [FM]) with respect to their ability of predicting TWL in Delaware Bay, United States. Based on a previously established model configuration, we simulate Hurricane Sandy and Isabel that affected the Bay and led to considerable damages and economic losses. We then evaluate model capabilities with tidal analysis, compare observed vs. simulated TWL and analyze spatiotemporal variations of TWL through scenario‐based simulations. Our results suggest that atmospheric forcing input in Delft3D‐FM significantly improves TWL predictions as compared to those of 2D HEC‐RAS. Furthermore, model simulations with Delft3D‐FM can be faster than 2D HEC‐RAS by a factor of 6–10. Despite these advantages, 2D HEC‐RAS (version 5.07) is a noncommercial software easier to implement and can be a simpler alternative for modeling extreme events when atmospheric forcing is not relevant in the model domain.}},

In the January 2022 phreatoplinian Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai eruption, four remarkably similar seismic subevents within a 5‐min interval occurred during the intensifying early eruptive phase. The subevents are similar in waveforms and durations (∼25 s each). Each subevent begins with an unusual negative P‐wave polarity which is inferred, using full‐wave seismic modeling, to be caused by an upward single‐force mechanism at the volcano created by a magma hammer likely in response to magma flow blockage/constriction during the early part of the eruption as discharge rapidly increased over orders of magnitude with concomitant conduit geometry evolution and instability. Our proposed episodic magma hammer model is consistent with thermodynamic and phase properties of the magmatic mixture, and yields an estimate of conduit mass flow in agreement with vent discharge rates derived from satellite imagery of plume heights. The seismic record of the 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai explosive eruption exhibited a remarkably regular pattern, recording repeating volcanic processes. Within an interval of ∼300 s during an early eruptive phase, four strong seismic subevents occurred and were recorded by global seismic stations. Detailed seismic analyses showed that each of these subevents is similar in waveform and duration and is characterized by a sequence of four forces: upward, downward, upward, and downward. We suggest that the first upward seismic force at the volcano was likely created by an ascending magma colliding with a blockage or conduit constriction that occurred during and because of the ongoing eruption. We attribute the other forces to upward magma backflow and piston motion in the conduit, owing to their similar time durations. The magma hammer mechanism allows us to estimate the magma flow rate in the subsurface conduit, which is consistent with the vent discharge rate observed by satellite imagery. The 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai eruption had four episodic seismic subevents with similar waveforms within ∼300 s An unusual upward force jump‐started each subevent A magma hammer explains the force and estimates the subsurface magma mass flux which fits the vent discharge rate based on satellite data The 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai eruption had four episodic seismic subevents with similar waveforms within ∼300 s An unusual upward force jump‐started each subevent A magma hammer explains the force and estimates the subsurface magma mass flux which fits the vent discharge rate based on satellite data}},

The solution manifolds induced by transport-dominated problems such as hyperbolic conservation laws typically exhibit nonlinear structures, which means that traditional model reduction methods based on linear approximations are inefficient when applied to these problems. In contrast, the approach introduced in this work derives reduced approximations that are nonlinear by explicitly composing global transport dynamics with locally linear approximations of the solution manifolds. A time-stepping scheme evolves the nonlinear reduced models by transporting local approximation spaces along the characteristic curves of the governing equations. The proposed computational procedure allows an offline/online decomposition and is online-efficient in the sense that the complexity of accurately time stepping the nonlinear reduced model is independent of that of the full model. Numerical experiments with transport through heterogeneous media and the Burgers equation show orders of magnitude speedups of the proposed nonlinear reduced models based on transported subspaces compared to traditional linear reduced models and full models.}},

Despite substantial progress, however, obtaining actionable details such as the spatially and temporally varying distribution and proximal causes of changing flooding hazard in cities remains a persistent challenge. Here, for the first time, physics-based hydrodynamic flood models driven by rainfall and storm surge simultaneously are used to estimate the magnitude and frequency of compound flooding events. We apply this to the particular case of New York City. We find that sea level rise (SLR) alone will increase the TC and ETC compound flooding hazard more significantly than changes in storm climatology as the climate warms. We also project that the probability of destructive Sandy-like compound flooding will increase by up to 5 times by the end of the century. Our results have strong implications for climate change adaptation in coastal communities.}},

Stakeholders must urgently address these risks to protect infrastructure and assets. Simulating future flood scenarios is crucial for estimating flood risk and damage efficiently and for identifying reliable and effective protective measures. This article uses the GIS-based Subdivision-Redistribution (GISSR) methodology, a high-speed, physics-based flood estimation tool, that is now extended to model subway system flooding and associated economic impacts. It identifies flooded tunnels and stations and quantifies indirect economic losses from subway inoperability using an input–output model. The model is validated against observed subway flooding during Hurricane Sandy. Each analysis, covering both above- and below-ground flooding in Lower Manhattan, takes less than 90 s on a single 4-core Intel Core i7-13620H CPU machine. Scenario analyses were conducted with NYC stakeholders, incorporating sea level rise projections and various protective measures. Results, benchmarked against NYC’s ongoing resiliency projects, demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptation/protective strategies, particularly when subway system-specific and coastal measures are combined, highlighting the model’s value as a practical guide for stakeholders.}},

abstract = {{Barrier islands can protect the mainland from flooding during storms through reduction of storm surge and dissipation of storm-generated wave energy. However, the protective capability is reduced when barrier islands breach and a direct hydrodynamic connection between the water bodies on both sides of the barrier island is established. Breaching of barrier islands during large storm events is complicated, involving nonlinear processes that connect water, sediment transport, dune height, and island width, among other factors. In order to assess how barrier-island breaching impacts flooding on the mainland, we used a statistical approach to analyze the sensitivity of mainland storm surge to barrier-island breaching by randomizing the location, time, and extent of a breach event. We created a framework that allows breaching to develop during the course of a simulation and imposes a breach in an approximation of a Gaussian bell curve that deepens over time. We show that simulating a storm event and varying the size, location, and number of breaches in the barrier island that mainland storm surge and horizontal inundation is affected by breaching; total inundation has a logarithmic relationship with total breach area which tapers off after the entire island is removed. Breach location is also an important predictor of inundation and bay surge. The insights we have gleaned from this study can help prepare shoreline communities for the differing ways that breaching affects the mainland coastline. Understanding which mainland locations are vulnerable to breaching, planners and coastal engineers can design interventions to reduce the likelihood of a breach occurring in areas adjacent to high flood risk.}},
