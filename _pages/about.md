Applied mathematician, computational scientist and coastal flood modeler with an interest in really good sandwiches.

### Research Interests

Numerical analysis and scientific computing for nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, including adaptive methods, uncertainty quantification, and high-performance computational frameworks. Applications to coastal flooding, geophysical hazards, and related transport-dominated systems.

### Bio

I am a Scientist IV at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF-NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu) in the [CGD Lab](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/). Before NCAR, I was a research scientist at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), faculty in the department of [applied physics and applied mathematics](https://www.apam.columbia.edu) at Columbia University and a postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin at what is now the [Oden Institute](https://oden.utexas.edu). I received my Ph.D. in [applied mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu) in 2011 from the University of Washington, studying [multi-layered shallow flows](http://hdl.handle.net/1773/16614). My research interests involve the computational and analytical aspects of geophysical shallow mass flows such as storm-surge, tsunamis, and other coastal flooding. This also includes the development of advanced computational approaches, such as adaptive mesh refinement, leveraging novel computational technologies, such as accelerators, and the application of good software development practices as applied more generally to scientific and engineering software. I am also involved in development of the [Clawpack](https://clawpack.org) package including [GeoClaw](http://www.clawpack.org/geoclaw) and [PyClaw](http://www.clawpack.org/pyclaw/).
