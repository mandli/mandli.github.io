Kyle Mandli is a Scientist IV at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF-NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu) in the [CGD Lab](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/).  Before NCAR, Kyle was a research scientist at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), faculty in the department of [applied physics and applied mathematics](https://www.apam.columbia.edu) at Columbia University and a postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin at what is now the [Oden Institute](https://oden.utexas.edu).  He received his Ph.D. in [applied mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu) in 2011 from the University of Washington, studying [multi-layered shallow flows](http://hdl.handle.net/1773/16614). Kyle’s research interests involve the computational and analytical aspects of geophysical shallow mass flows such as storm-surge, tsunamis, and other coastal flooding. This also includes the development of advanced computational approaches, such as adaptive mesh refinement, leveraging novel computational technologies, such as accelerators, and the application of good software development practices as applied more generally to scientific and engineering software.  He is also involved in development of the [Clawpack](https://clawpack.org) package including [GeoClaw](http://www.clawpack.org/geoclaw) and [PyClaw](http://www.clawpack.org/pyclaw/).

### Research Interests
**Computational mathematics** with applications to **coastal floods** and other **geophysical hazards**. Includes numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs, high performance computing, and software development practices in scientific and engineering software.
